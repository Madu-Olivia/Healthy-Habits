         <h2>
            Ideal Study Time vs. Break Time
         </h2>
         <p>
            Research shows that studying in short bursts (about 25-50 minutes) followed by 
            a 5-10 minutes break helps your brain stay focused and remember more. Try using the<em> Pomodoro technique </em>- study, pause, refresh and repeat.

   <h2>
    Brain-Booosting Snacks
   </h2>
   <p>
    Keep your brain energized with light snacks like nuts, yogurt,
    or fruits. Avoid caffeine - they might give you quick energy but 
    can make you tired later.

  <h2>
    Posture Tips While Studying
  </h2>
  <p>
    Sit upright with your back supported and your screen or book at eye level.
    Bad posture can cause back or neck pain and make studying uncomfortable over time.

<h2>
    Importance Of Sleep
</h2>
   <p>
    Good sleep is like "saving progress" for your brain.  Aim for 7-8 hours 
    each night to help your mind store what you've learned and wake up refreshed for new lessons.
